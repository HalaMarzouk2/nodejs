# nodejs
"In this project, I developed a Node.js application and containerized it using Docker. 
then pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub, making it readily available for deployment.

To manage the application in a scalable and efficient manner, I utilized Kubernetes. I set up a Kubernetes cluster and deployed my containerized application to it. The Kubernetes deployment provides automated scaling of the application pods, ensuring that my service can handle fluctuations in user demand.

Furthermore, I have configured the Kubernetes deployment to expose my application externally, allowing users to access it easily. This setup ensures that my Node.js application is readily available and can scale as needed to meet the requirements of my users.

To share the details of my project, I have documented the step-by-step process on my GitHub repository. Additionally, I have included the YAML files for the Kubernetes deployment, allowing others to easily understand and potentially replicate the architecture I have implemented.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to build and deploy a containerized Node.js application using modern DevOps practices, including the use of Docker and Kubernetes. I am proud of the robust and scalable solution I have created, and I believe it demonstrates my proficiency in these technologies."
